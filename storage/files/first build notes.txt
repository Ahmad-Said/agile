let's imagine a welcome screen where only a login button is showen
everything start with tinker after adding the first registered user as
admin where he can register coaches user types of user with
 a default password sent by email maybe outside of our project at first
now let's talk about each user:

-admin: can login and add coaches

-Product owner: type of user who own the project 
-Scrum Master: he is a developer like the leader in agile system he do meeting and resolve problem
-Developer a default type of user in the project

........... the above user have similar functionallity we will add later a messaging system between them maybe the form links sent in it within a post form the message box may be just simple chat or other section for forms all
ordered by desc time of create
a dashboard of form and in each form set of question with submit 

-Coach : he is the one who wants to test the effictivity of agile method
a coach can have teams constructed of at least of one of the above user types where only can exist more developer 
and at last the coach sends form set of question to answer graduted from 1 to 5 or maybe variable and when filled by the teams at any times he see results and charts.
he also can register Other Coaches which have the same job.

Main mission to do:
1- Team Management:
	1.1- Register user with a form where he can choose types of the user
		the default password '123' as hidden input sent at finish
	1.2- Team Creation:
		- will be Team name location information
		- will be a 2 select list: 
		// always use @if there exist such types other
		// wise	 show a button to register an employee
			-choose a owner
			-choose a scrum-master
		- A table in each like the availble free developer 
			at each tr there is check box id as array see course
			like id='choice[]' and if checked it will be auto added
			and the value can be the developper id.

2- like PostCreation "Form question" :
		-note that team of product owner is not that much important because team take project if he has one we send to owner not if not 
			only show team member
		-in main menu there also a dashborad for all post with subject a button to add post or edit the availble post and delete them
				-when create a post is tapped choose a subject then it redirect to its dashboard where can see add question
		-in form dash we can see all question .. its a recursive way to see things..
		-in question form choose question body string and choices 
		- also in form dash will be a button "send" redirect to page as post method the id of form and specify groupe and in each group a expand 
				the coaches will be in send

about database tables:
user:	 	id integer,
-----		name string,
			email string,
			password string,
			type string,
			parentid,
			teamid,  //  can be null or by default it is 1 and name of that team is 'No current team' location='not defined' and coachid is 1 the admin
			
			
			relation ships:
			// we are building 2 relations ships one to many reflexive between user and team
			// so many user are in one team
			// and coach can create and own many teams
			public function team(){
				return $this->belongsTo('App\Team');
			}
			
			public function coachteams()
			{
				return $this->hasMany('App\Team');
			}
			
	
team:		id integer,
------		name string,
			location string,
			coachid integer foreign key,  // this is a belong to coach one coach to many teams

			
				// in interface must consider conditions see Team Creation up
				// actually we will not create this table
				// this can be added to model teams and add 
				    public function user(){
						return $this->hasMany('App\User');
					}
					
					public function ourcoach(){
						return $this->belongsTo('App\User');
					}
project

					
------------------------
desgin to do later:
in http://agile.test/team/create do make pagination for table while conserving post values of memebers
show speicfic error if teams not created 3 owner scrum developer  
do for button when no more availble user redirect changing the selection box to a value using javascript and post value
